# Release performance CI

`Nitro Performance` builds the dedicated `apps/benchmark` Release/Hermes app.
Each platform runs base → head → head → base on the same machine, reversing case
order for the second pair. Each case gets a fresh app process; installation,
startup, transport and process restarts are outside timing. There is no automatic
third pair. Manual reruns are retained as identifiable workflow attempts.

A separate base calibration process chooses one per-case iteration and chunk
plan. Both revisions then use that plan for five warmup batches and twenty ordered
measurements in fresh processes. Incompatible counts fail rather than silently
shortening head work. Calibration targets 150 ms of timed work; this target does not establish steady
state or erase drift. Allocation-heavy cases sum bounded timed chunks with
explicit cleanup outside timing. Raw `iterations`, `chunkIterations` and ordered
`samplesNsPerOp` describe the work; timed sample milliseconds are
`ns/op * iterations / 1e6`. Slow samples are retained.

## Reading results

The main score is the median (p50) of batch averages in ns/op, not individual-call
tail latency. The report shows every observed change of at least 5%, including
Promise cases. This is a presentation threshold, not a calibrated regression
budget. Expand the report for all metrics, individual process medians, matched
pair changes, and sample MAD relative to p50. Matching pooled medians do not prove
equal performance. Two process pairs do not justify confidence intervals.

Performance is currently report-only. Build, execution and malformed-result
failures still fail CI. Turning observed differences into a regression gate needs
empirical validation on unchanged commits and intentional slowdowns on each
unchanged suite/testbed. No Promise case is permanently exempt. Scheduled/manual
runs with the same base and head SHA measure baseline variation explicitly.
Changed benchmark definitions run two head-only measurements as a new baseline,
without executing the old base app or publishing an invented paired baseline.
This also handles the first rollout of a new runner protocol.

## Saved apps and measurement reruns

The workflow separates preparation, platform builds, platform measurements and
collection. Each measurement job downloads the immutable app artifact ID produced
by its build job; base and head still run together on one machine. A changed suite
builds only head. An identical base/head SHA reuses the same binary for both sides.
Otherwise each revision is built from its own checkout with the same build script.

Use GitHub's **Re-run job and dependent jobs** on `measure-android` or
`measure-ios` to repeat measurements without rebuilding successful ancestors.
Collection downloads the exact result IDs from those jobs. An untouched platform
keeps its original attempt; the report records and links both platform measurement
attempts and their app build attempts. Rerunning all jobs intentionally rebuilds.
Apps and results expire after 30 days; an expired artifact requires a new build.

The app artifact includes base/head SHAs, suite hashes, Release configuration,
architecture and toolchain metadata. iOS apps are tar archives to preserve
permissions and symlinks. Gradle's basic cache is the sole Android cache owner;
Gradle still checks source/task inputs, while exact app reuse is by artifact ID.
There is no new iOS compiler cache. First-run speed or CI stability improvements
have not been measured; app reuse specifically avoids build work on manual reruns.

## Artifacts and publishing

The canonical artifact is `performance-report-<attempt>`: raw JSON for every
measured process and discarded calibration plan, plus `performance-report.json` with repository, revisions,
workflow run and attempt provenance, original build metadata and measurement artifact IDs. Artifacts remain available for 30 days.
The PR comment links its exact immutable artifact ID; downloads require GitHub
access. An agent can inspect the JSON instead of scraping the rendered table.

One default-branch `Publish Nitro Performance` workflow handles internal PRs,
forks and main runs. It downloads the exact artifact from the triggering attempt,
validates bounded JSON against GitHub's run and current PR metadata, and computes
the comparison, Markdown and Bencher values from raw samples. It never installs
or executes PR code or app artifacts. Docs-only and cancelled runs skip
publication. Markdown/MDX-only edits also skip measurements inside package/app directories. Relevant failures remain failures. Stale PR results are skipped.

The trusted publisher uses `BENCHER_KEY` as an Actions secret. Its CLI version and
binary digest are pinned. Bencher receives median latency values without invented
bounds; its JSON adapter requires only `value`. PR publications seed both measured
platform baselines at `baseline-<base SHA>` before recording the head at
`pr-<number>`. Main runs record main history. Bencher receives history only: it does not post a second GitHub comment or create alert-driven checks. The trusted renderer owns the one PR comment. User comments are never edited.

The raw-manifest publisher and producer land together in the first cleanup PR.
Until that PR reaches the default branch, the previous trusted reporter cannot
consume its new manifest. Merge the complete producer/publisher stack before relying on its new provenance contract;
there is no permanent old-schema reporting path. Existing raw app results may
contain extra summary fields, which the raw parser ignores.

## Android host requirements

The API 36 x86_64 emulator requires KVM. CI checks `/dev/kvm`, verifies acceleration
before boot and uses `-accel on`; it must not silently use software CPU emulation.
Software GPU rendering is separate. Base/head measurements stay on that machine.
Android process failures retain logcat and process-exit diagnostics. Both platforms
bound boot time to five minutes and individual install/launch commands to two.

The benchmark app shares real Nitro test packages without Harness/navigation UI.
Correctness remains in `apps/example`. See the [benchmark app README](../apps/benchmark/README.md)
for local build and run commands.

## Remaining upstream warnings

The benchmark now uses the supported ReactModuleInfo constructor and matching
`reactContext` parameter name. Its Gradle property assignments use current syntax.
AGP/RN and Nitro package Gradle warnings remain outside that focused app edit.
Android uses supported `-gpu swiftshader` with required KVM CPU acceleration.

The emulator action hardcodes `cmdline-tools/latest`. Older hosted SDK managers
can still emit the XML v3/v4 metadata warning. Updating only the action does not
replace an installed SDK manager; latest command-line tools 23 also deprecates
`sdkmanager` in favor of the Android CLI. This change logs the selected SDK manager
and version, and leaves provisioning to the runner/action rather than patching its
SDK layout. This inherited warning is not suppressed.
