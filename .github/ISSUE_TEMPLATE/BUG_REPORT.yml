      description: >
        Share a small reproduceable code snippet here (or the entire file if necessary).
        Most importantly, share your native code (your HybridObjects), and ideally also the .nitro.ts specs, as well as the generated protocols/interfaces.

      description: >
        Paste any relevant **native log output** (Xcode Logs/Android Studio Logcat) here.
        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.

        * For iOS, run the project through Xcode and copy the logs from the log window.

        * For Android, either open the project through Android Studio and paste the logs from the logcat window, or run `adb logcat` in terminal.
