   * HybridRecyclableTestViewSpecSwift (C++) accesses HybridRecyclableTestViewSpec_cxx (Swift), and might
   * contain some additional bridging code for C++ <> Swift interop.
   *
   * Since this obviously introduces an overhead, I hope at some point in
   * the future, HybridRecyclableTestViewSpec_cxx can directly inherit from the C++ class HybridRecyclableTestViewSpec
   * to simplify the whole structure and memory management.
