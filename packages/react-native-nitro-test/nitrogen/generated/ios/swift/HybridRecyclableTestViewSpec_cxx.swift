/**
 * A class implementation that bridges HybridRecyclableTestViewSpec over to C++.
 * In C++, we cannot use Swift protocols - so we need to wrap it in a class to make it strongly defined.
 *
 * Also, some Swift types need to be bridged with special handling:
 * - Enums need to be wrapped in Structs, otherwise they cannot be accessed bi-directionally (Swift bug: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues/75330)
 * - Other HybridObjects need to be wrapped/unwrapped from the Swift TCxx wrapper
 * - Throwing methods need to be wrapped with a Result<T, Error> type, as exceptions cannot be propagated to C++
