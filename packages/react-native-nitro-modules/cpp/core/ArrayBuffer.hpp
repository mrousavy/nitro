/**
 * Represents a raw byte buffer that can be read from-, and
 * written to- from both JavaScript and C++.
 * `ArrayBuffer` is not thread-safe and does not lock multi-thread access.
 *
 * `ArrayBuffer` can either be a `JSArrayBuffer`, or a `NativeArrayBuffer`.
 * - `NativeArrayBuffer`: Created from native (C++), and can either own the memory (`isOwner()`), or borrow it.
 * - `JSArrayBuffer`: Received from JS, and will only be alive for as long as the JS Runtime is actually alive.
 *
 * Also, an `ArrayBuffer` can either own its memory, or just borrow its memory.
 * - Owning = the `ArrayBuffer`'s `data()` is alive as long as the `ArrayBuffer` is alive.
 *   When this `ArrayBuffer` gets deleted, it will free the memory.
 * - Borrowed = the `ArrayBuffer`'s `data()` might be deleted at any point from an external source (e.g. the JS garbage collector).
 *   When this `ArrayBuffer` gets deleted, the memory will not be freed explicitly, as someone else owns it.
