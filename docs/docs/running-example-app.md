# Running the Example app

This guide will help you understand the [Nitro Example app](https://github.com/mrousavy/nitro/tree/main/example)'s role, and teach you how to run it both in debug and in release.

## The Example app's purpose

Nitro's development always targets the example app (under `example/`). It narrows down user bugs by the following criteria;

- If you have a bug in your code, but the same code works in the Nitro example app, it's a **user error** and won't/can't be fixed.
- If you have a bug in your code that can also be reproduced inside the Nitro example app, it's a **Nitro bug**, which might get fixed in a future PR.

A bug report will only be taken seriously when there is a **clear reproduction**, and you can also reproduce the same bug in the example app. Anything else is considered a **user error** and **will be closed**.


The example app contains 4 screens;

1. A **"Tests"** screen where over 170 different test cases for Nitro Modules are covered.
2. A **"Benchmarks"** screen where a simple Nitro Module is benchmarked against a Turbo Module.
3. A **"Views"** screen where hundreds of Nitro Views mount and unmount periodically.
4. A **"Eval"** screen where you can run custom code using Nitro APIs.

These should allow you to test all Nitro features in a single app, which is useful for finding bugs or regressions - e.g. by running specific code and comparing results with older versions of the example app.

## Run the pre-built example app (release)

Each release of Nitro contains a pre-built release version of the [Nitro Example app](https://github.com/mrousavy/nitro/tree/main/example). You can download the pre-built `.app`/`.apk` from [the latest Nitro release](https://github.com/mrousavy/nitro/releases/latest), and run it on your iOS Simulator, or Android Simulator/Device.

### iOS

#### Simulator

To run the iOS app, first start an iOS Simulator;

```sh
open -a Simulator
```

Then, simply drag the `.app` into the Simulator's window.

### Android

#### Emulator

To run the Android app, start an Android Emulator;

```sh
emulator -list-avds
emulator -avd <name>
```

Then, simply drag the `.apk` into the Emulator's window.

#### Device

To run the `.apk` on a physical Android device, simply download the `.apk` from the GitHub releases on your phone, and open it. Your OS will install & run it.

## Build the example app yourself (debug)

To run the example app yourself, make sure you have a [working React Native environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) set up, and have installed [Bun](https://bun.com).

Then, simply clone (potentially also fork?) the Nitro repository and install it's dependencies:


<Tabs groupId="host-os">
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS" default>

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mrousavy/nitro
    cd nitro
    bun bootstrap
    ```

    #### iOS

    To run the iOS app of Nitro Example, open `example/ios/NitroExample.xcworkspace` in Xcode, and hit run.

    The `bun bootstrap` command should have ensured that Pods are installed.

    #### Android

    To run the Android app of Nitro Example, first open Android Studio:

    ```sh
    open -a "Android Studio"
    ```

    Then, open `example/android/` in Android Studio.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="other" label="Windows/Linux">

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mrousavy/nitro
    cd nitro
    bun i
    bun run build
    ```

    #### Android

    To run the Android app of Nitro Example, first open Android Studio:

    ```sh
    open -a "Android Studio"
    ```

    Then, open `example/android/` in Android Studio.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Reproducing bugs

In addition to `packages/nitrogen` ([nitrogen](nitrogen) CLI) and `packages/react-native-nitro-modules` ([Nitro Modules](nitro-modules) core), the nitro repository also contains two testing libraries;

- `packages/react-native-nitro-test`: Contains a lot of tests for C++/Swift/Kotlin Hybrid Objects, functions and types.
- `packages/react-native-nitro-test-external`: Contains a Hybrid Object that is used in `react-native-nitro-test` to test cross-library-imports.

**You can use those testing libraries to reproduce any bugs you might encounter with Nitro** - if you manage to reproduce your bug, simply open a **draft** PR against Nitro with the necessary changes so I can see what makes it break. Based on that, I have clear runnable reproduction, and can fix bugs faster.

#### Changing specs

Every time you change a Nitro spec in one of those two test libraries, you can simply re-generate specs in the root folder;

```sh
bun specs
```

This runs [nitrogen](nitrogen) for both test libraries. You might need to reinstall pods if any iOS files changed;

```sh
bun example pods
```

Then simply run again.
