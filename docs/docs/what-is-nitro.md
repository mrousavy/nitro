# What is Nitro?

Nitro is a framework for building powerful and fast native modules in React Native.

- A [**Nitro Module**](nitro-modules) is a library built with Nitro. It contains one or more **Hybrid Objects**.
- A [**Hybrid Object**](hybrid-objects) is a native object in Nitro, implemented in either C++, Swift or Kotlin.
- [**Nitrogen**](nitrogen) is a code-generator a library author can use to generate native bindings from a custom TypeScript interface.

<div className="side-by-side-container">
<div className="side-by-side-block">

```ts title="Math.nitro.ts"
interface Math extends HybridObject {
  readonly pi: number
  add(a: number, b: number): number
}
```

</div>
<div className="side-by-side-block">

```swift title="HybridMath.swift"
class HybridMath : HybridMathSpec {
  var pi: Double {
    return Double.pi
  }
  func add(a: Double, b: Double) -> Double {
    return a + b
  }
}
```

</div>
</div>

This Hybrid Object can then be accessed directly from JS:

```ts
const math = NitroModules.createHybridObject<Math>('Math')
const result = math.add(5, 7)
```

## Performance

Nitro is all about **performance**. [This benchmark](https://github.com/mrousavy/NitroBenchmarks) compares the total execution time when calling a single native method 100.000 times:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>ExpoModules</th>
    <th>TurboModules</th>
    <th>NitroModules</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>100.000x <code>addNumbers(...)</code></td>
    <td>434.85ms</td>
    <td>115.86ms</td>
    <td><b>7.27ms</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>100.000x <code>addStrings(...)</code></td>
    <td>429.53ms</td>
    <td>179.02ms</td>
    <td><b>29.94ms</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Note: These benchmarks only compare native method throughput in extreme cases, and do not necessarily reflect real world use-cases. In a real-world app, results may vary. See [NitroBenchmarks](https://github.com/mrousavy/NitroBenchmarks) for full context.

### Lightweight layer

While Nitro is built on top of JSI, the layer is very lightweight and efficient.
Many things like type-checking is compile-time only, and built with C++ templates or `constexpr` which introduces zero runtime overhead.

### Direct Swift &lt;&gt; C++ interop

Unlike Turbo- or Expo-Modules, Nitro-Modules does not use Objective-C at all.
Nitro is built using the new [Swift &lt;&gt; C++ interop](https://www.swift.org/documentation/cxx-interop/), which is close to zero-overhead.

### Uses `jsi::NativeState`

Hybrid Objects in Nitro are built on top of `jsi::NativeState`, which is more efficient than `jsi::HostObject`. Such objects have proper native prototypes, and their native memory size is known, which allows the garbage collector to properly clean up unused objects.

## Type Safety

Nitro Modules are **type-safe** and **null-safe**. By using Nitro's code-generator, [nitrogen](nitrogen), TypeScript specs are the single source of truth as generated native interfaces have to exactly represent the declared types.
If a function declares a `number`, you can only implement it on the native side as a `Double`, otherwise the app will not compile.

<div className="side-by-side-container">
<div className="side-by-side-block">

```ts title="Math.nitro.ts"
interface Math extends HybridObject {
  add(a: number, b: number): number
}
```

</div>
<div className="side-by-side-block">

```swift title="HybridMath.swift"
class HybridMath : HybridMathSpec {
  func add(a: Double, b: Double) -> String {
// code-error
//  Compile-error: Expected Double! ^
    return a + b
  }
}
```

</div>
</div>

### Null-safety

There is no way for a Nitro Module to return a type that is not expected in TypeScript, which also guarantees null-safety.

```ts
interface Math extends HybridObject {
  getValue(): number
  getValueOrNull(): number | undefined
}
```

## Object-Oriented approach

Every Hybrid Object in Nitro is a native object, which can be created, passed around, and destroyed.

```ts
interface Image extends HybridObject {
  readonly width: number
  readonly height: number
  saveToFile(path: string): Promise<void>
}

interface ImageEditor extends HybridObject {
  loadImage(path: string): Promise<Image>
  crop(image: Image, size: Size): Image
}
```

Functions (or "callbacks") are also first-class citizens of Nitro, which means they can safely be kept in memory, called as often as needed, and will automatically be cleaned up when no longer needed.
This is somewhat similar to how other frameworks (like Turbo-Modules) implement "events".

## Modern Languages

Nitro is a modern framework, built on top of modern languages like Swift and Kotlin.
It has first-class support for modern language features.

### Swift

Nitro bridges to Swift directly using the new highly efficient [Swift &lt;&gt; C++ interop](https://www.swift.org/documentation/cxx-interop/).

* **Protocols**: Every Hybrid Object's generated specification is a [Swift protocol](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/protocols/).
* **Properties**: A getter (and setter) property can be implemented using [Swift properties](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/).
* **Async**/**Await**: Asynchronous functions can use Swift's new [async/await syntax](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/concurrency/) using the `Promise.async` API.
* **No Objective-C**: Instead of bridging through Objective-C interfaces, Nitro bridges to Swift directly from C++.

### Kotlin

Nitro bridges to Kotlin directly using [fbjni](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fbjni).

* **Interfaces**: Every Hybrid Object's generated specification is a [Kotlin interface](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/interfaces.html).
* **Properties**: A getter (and setter) property can be implemented using [Kotlin properties](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/properties.html).
* **Coroutines**: Asynchronous functions can use Kotlin's [coroutine syntax](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) using the `Promise.async` API.
* **No Java**: Instead of requiring Java classes, Nitro bridges to Kotlin directly.
