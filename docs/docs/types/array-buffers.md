# ArrayBuffers (`ArrayBuffer`)

Array Buffers allow highly efficient access to the same data from both JS and native.
Passing an `ArrayBuffer` from native to JS and back does not involve any copies, and is therefore the fastest way of passing around data in Nitro.

It is important to understand the ownership, and threading concerns around such shared memory access.

## Ownership

There's two types of `ArrayBuffer`s, **owning** and **non-owning**:

### Owning

An `ArrayBuffer` that was created on the native side is **owning**, which means you can safely access it's data as long as the `ArrayBuffer` reference is alive.
It can be safely held strong for longer, e.g. as a class property/member, and accessed from different Threads.

```swift
func doSomething() -> ArrayBuffer {
  // highlight-next-line
  let buffer = ArrayBuffer.allocate(1024 * 10)
  let data = buffer.data   // <-- ✅ safe to do because we own it!
  self.buffer = buffer     // <-- ✅ safe to use it later!
  DispatchQueue.global().async {
    let data = buffer.data // <-- ✅ also safe because we own it!
  }
  return buffer
}
```

### Non-owning

An `ArrayBuffer` that was received as a parameter from JS cannot be safely kept strong as the JS VM can delete it at any point, hence it is **non-owning**.
It's data can only be safely accessed before the synchronous function returned, as this will stay within the JS bounds.

```swift
func doSomething(buffer: ArrayBuffer) {
  let data = buffer.data   // <-- ✅ safe to do because we're still sync
  DispatchQueue.global().async {
    // code-error
    let data = buffer.data // <-- ❌ NOT safe
  }
}
```
If you need a non-owning buffer's data for longer, **copy it first**:
```swift
func doSomething(buffer: ArrayBuffer) {
  // diff-add
  let copy = ArrayBuffer.copy(of: buffer)
  let data = copy.data   // <-- ✅ safe now because we have a owning copy
  DispatchQueue.global().async {
    let data = copy.data // <-- ✅ still safe now because we have a owning copy
  }
}
```

## Threading

An `ArrayBuffer` can be accessed from both JS and native, and even from multiple Threads at once, but they are **not thread-safe**.
To prevent race conditions or garbage-data from being read, make sure to not read from- and write to- the `ArrayBuffer` at the same time.

## Creating Buffers

Buffers can either be created from native (**owning**), or from JS (**non-owning**).

### From native

On the native side, an **owning** `ArrayBuffer` can either **wrap-**, or **copy-** an existing buffer:

<Tabs groupId="native-language">
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">
    ```swift
    let myData = UnsafeMutablePointer<UInt8>.allocate(capacity: 4096)

    // wrap (no copy)
    let wrappingArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer.wrap(dataWithoutCopy: myData,
                                               size: 4096,
                                               onDelete: { myData.deallocate() })
    // copy
    let copiedArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer.copy(of: wrappingArrayBuffer)
    // new blank buffer
    let newArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer.allocate(size: 4096)
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    ```kotlin
    val myData = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(4096)

    // wrap (no copy)
    val wrappingArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer.wrap(myData)


    // copy
    let copiedArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer.copy(myData)
    // new blank buffer
    val newArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer.allocate(4096)
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">
    ```cpp
    auto myData = new uint8_t[4096];

    // wrap (no copy)
    auto wrappingArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer::wrap(myData, 4096, [=]() {
      delete[] myData;
    });
    // copy
    auto copiedArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer::copy(myData, 4096);
    // new blank buffer
    auto newArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer::allocate(4096);
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Language-native buffer types

ArrayBuffers also provide helper and conversion methods for the language-native conventional buffer types:

<Tabs groupId="native-language">
  <TabItem value="swift" label="Swift">
    Swift often uses [`Data`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data) to represent Data.
    ```swift
    let data = Data(capacity: 1024)
    let buffer = ArrayBuffer.copy(data: data)
    let dataAgain = buffer.toData(copyIfNeeded: true)
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">
    Kotlin often uses [`ByteBuffer`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/nio/ByteBuffer) to represent Data.
    ```kotlin
    val data = ByteBuffer.allocateDirect(1024)
    val buffer = ArrayBuffer.copy(data)
    val dataAgain = buffer.getBuffer(copyIfNeeded = true)
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">
    C++ often uses [`std::vector<uint8_t>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) to represent Data.
    ```cpp
    std::vector<uint8_t> data;
    auto buffer = ArrayBuffer::copy(data);
    /* convert back to vector would be a copy. */
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### From JS

From JS, a **non-owning** `ArrayBuffer` can be created via the [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) web APIs, and viewed or edited using the typed array APIs (e.g. [`Uint8Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array)).

```ts
const arrayBuffer = new ArrayBuffer(4096)
const view = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer)
view[0] = 64
view[1] = 128
view[2] = 255
```
